In order to have a discussion about your skills and approach to front-end development, we have outlined a small project for you to complete in advance of the second round interview. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate how you would solve a development problem, showing your use of HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript / JQuery. 

The assignment is to recreate the attached comps from scratch. You can use the HTML file as a starting point, which links to the fonts, Bootstrap, and latest jQuery. The brand colors are available here: https://brand.vt.edu/identity/color/color-util.html

The requirements:

- must adhere to comp elements/layout
- must include all comp options and working features (all but actual submit action)
- must be responsive based on Bootstrap 4
- must use JavaScript, jQuery 3, or both to accomplish all functions
- must use brand fonts and colors (fonts linked into starting HTML file with BS4 and jQ3)
- must validate currency input field with $10,000 limit
- must display how a URL would change as options change via developer console, see "?option1=value&option2=value" or the like in console
- all code must be human readable, not minified
